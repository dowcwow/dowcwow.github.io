    <h1>Version 1.1.1 - July 13, 2025</h1>

    <h2>New features and QOL improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>New platform type: disappearing platforms! Look for these when you are further in your run!</li>
      <li>Upgrade spawns are now guaranteed after certain scores.</li>
      <li>You now spawn with 3 hearts instead of 2.</li>
      <li>Fixed the issue where the ground looked separated.</li>
      <li>Lifesaver perk will now only appear 3 times in a run.</li>
      <li>OP perk now only saves the previously acquired perks, and lasts for the next 3 runs (even if you close the game).</li>
      <li>Removed the "permanent perk" text on certain upgrade cards.</li>
      <li>Changed font for the privacy text and version text.</li>
      <li>Changed color of the upgrade diamond.</li>
      <li>Fixed the buggy looking hydration bar.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dev Blabber</h2>
    
<p>I found that after getting most of the perks, the game became very boring and easy. The disappearing platforms are one way to make things interesting, but definitely not the end goal. More ideas in the works regarding that.</p>
<p>I didn't like how upgrade spawns were based purely on luck, so I made a system where it relies on your score. This promotes getting perfect landings and gives the player peace of mind that an upgrade will happen.</p>
<p>Spawning with 3 hearts tremendously helps not getting destroyed when you are new to the game, and allows you to see what the game has to offer.</p>
<p>Lifesaver perk was overpowered in the late game. If you had every perk, you could just cycle that forever.</p>
<p>OP perk was too strong, and now allows you to strategically decide if you want the perk when you get the chance, or get more upgrades before then and risk losing them all.</p>
